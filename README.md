## Kirby + Vue.js 3 Starterkit

### Key Features

- 🖖 Vue.js 3 powered
- ⚡️ [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) instead of Vue.js CLI
- ♿ Accessible routing
- 🔍 SEO-friendly ([server-side generated](site/snippets/meta.php) meta tags)
- 🦋 [Cache pages between sessions](#caching) and revalidate with modification timestamps
- 🗃️ Centralized state management without Vuex
- 🤝 Shared `.env` file for frontend & backend
- 🚀 Modern Kirby folder setup

### Introduction

This project is a starting point for [Vue.js v3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) as the frontend UI library and [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) as headless CMS. The content is provided as JSON through Kirby and fetched by the frontend.

It's a simple, zero-setup, almost identical port of the [Kirby 3 starterkit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit) frontend (snippets, templates and their corresponding JS/CSS) to Vue.js single file components. By "almost" meaning that some features have been added like meta tags generation, environment variables support, accessible routing etc.

To compile the frontend sources, [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) comes to use. Vite is an opinionated web development build tool, created by Evan You. It serves code via native ES Module imports during development, allowing you to develop Vue.js single file components without a bundle step, and bundles it with Rollup for production. Features include:
- Lightning fast cold server start
- Instant hot module replacement (HMR)
- [Head over to the GitHub page](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for more details

## Caching

Even without caching enabled, the frontend will store pages between indiviual routes/views. Once you reload the tab however, every page data has to be fetched from the api once again.

To forestall repetitive HTTP requests, the store state (including cached pages data) may be persisted between tabs or browser sessions. By that, the store state will be saved to `IndexedDB` each time a page has been fetched:

![Caching for Kirby and Vue 3 starterkit](./.github/kirby-vue-3-cache-and-store.png)

While calling up the website for the first time, the `home` page will be always be fetched. It holds `site` data with an index of modification timestamps for each page id. This is relevant, because before using a cached page, the timestamp will be compared with the latest modification timestamp from the site modification index. If it differs, the cached page will be removed and freshly fetched.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js with npm (only required to build the frontend)
- PHP 7.4+

> Kirby is not a free software. You can try it for free on your local machine but in order to run Kirby on a public server you must purchase a [valid license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

## Setup

1. Duplicate the [`.env.example`](.env.example) as `.env` and optionally adapt its values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**Note**: Composer dependencies are tracked in this repository by default. Running `composer install` isn't necessary.

## Usage

### Serve backend & frontend for development

```bash
# Runs `npm run kirby:serve` and `npm run dev` in parallel
npm run start
```

Out of the box the backend is automatically served while developing. `npm run kirby:serve` spawns the PHP built-in web server by Node. You can also serve the backend by a web server of your choice. If done so, please specify hostname and port in your `.env` if they differ from `127.0.0.1`and `8080` respectifely so that the decoupled frontend can call the Kirby API for JSON content in development.

### Compile for production

Build the frontend assets (CSS & JS files) to `public/assets`:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Note**: If you wish to target older browsers, run `npm run build:compat` which transpiles to `es2017`. For even older browsers, you can change the target in the `package.json`'s npm script.

### Configuration

All development and production related configurations for both backend and frontend code are located in your `.env` file:
- `KIRBY_SERVER_HOSTNAME` and `KIRBY_SERVER_PORT` specify the address where you wish the Kirby backend to be served from. It is used by the frontend to fetch content data as JSON.
- Keys starting with `VITE_` are available in your code following the `import.meta.env.VITE_CUSTOM_VARIABLE` syntax.

To enable the **persistent store** which caches pages between browser sessions, set:
- `KIRBY_CACHE` to `true`
- `VITE_PERSIST_API_STORE` to `true`

### Deployment

1. Deploy whole repository on your server.
2. Duplicate [`.env.example`](.env.example) as `.env`.
3. Install npm dependencies and build frontend assets: `npm i && npm run build`.
4. Change variables in your `.env`:
   - `KIRBY_DEBUG` to `false`
   - `KIRBY_CACHE` to `true` (recommended)
   - `VITE_PERSIST_API_STORE` to `true` (optional)
5. Point your web server to the `public` folder.
6. Some hosting environments require to uncomment `RewriteBase /` in [`.htaccess`](public/.htaccess) to make site links work.

Now your project is hopefully up 'n' running!
